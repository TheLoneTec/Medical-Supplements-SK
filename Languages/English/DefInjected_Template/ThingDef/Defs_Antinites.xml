  <MSAntinites.description>Refined from Luciferium this modified concoction of mechanites can be used to attack other unwanted mechanites in the body. Phenol and Smokeleaf are added into this mix to create a toxic effect targeting unwanted nanites in the system. As a result the experience though short lived, for about half a day, can be quite painful. It would be wise to take some form of pain relief prior to or just after using the injection.</MSAntinites.description>
